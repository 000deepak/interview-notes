Angular Pipes
==================

Angular Pipes are used to transform data on a template, without writing a boilerplate code in a component.

A pipe takes in data as input and transforms it to the desired output. It is like a filter in Angular 1 (AngularJS).

Generally, If we need to transform data, we write the code in the component, For example, we want to transform todayâ€™s date into a format like `'16 Apr 2018'` or `'16-04-2018'`
,We need to write separate code in the component.

So instead of writing separate boilerplate code, we can use the built-in pipe called `DatePipe` which will take input and transform it into the desired date format.

Types of Pipes in Angular:
---------------
The Angular Framework divided the Pipes into two types i.e. 
1. Built-in Pipes and 
2. Custom Pipes. 
   
Further Built-in Pipes are divided into two types i.e. Parameterized and chaining as shown in the below image.

 Built-in Pipes
-----------------

Angular provides built-in pipes for typical data transformations, including transformations for internationalization (i18n), which use locale information to format data. The following are commonly used built-in pipes for data formatting:


[DatePipe](https://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe): Formats a date value according to locale rules.

[UpperCasePipe](https://angular.io/api/common/UpperCasePipe): Transforms text to all upper case.

[LowerCasePipe](https://angular.io/api/common/LowerCasePipe): Transforms text to all lower case.

[CurrencyPipe](https://angular.io/api/common/CurrencyPipe): Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.

[DecimalPipe](https://angular.io/api/common/DecimalPipe): Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted according to locale rules.

[PercentPipe](https://angular.io/api/common/PercentPipe): Transforms a number to a percentage string, formatted according to locale rules.

For example,
```html
<table border="1">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Student ID</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>DOB</th>
            <th>Gender</th>
            <th>CourseFee</th>            
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr *ngFor='let student of students'>
            <td>{{student.ID | uppercase}}</td>
            <td>{{student.Name | titlecase}}</td>
            <td>{{student.DOB | date:'dd/MM/yyyy'}}</td>
            <td>{{student.Gender | lowercase}}</td>
            <td>{{student.CourseFee | currency:'USD':true}}</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```
