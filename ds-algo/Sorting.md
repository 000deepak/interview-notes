# Sorting


Sorting is an algorithm that arranges the elements of a list in a certain order [either ascending or descending]. The output is a permutation or reordering of the input.


Sorting is one of the important categories of algorithms in computer science and a lot of research has gone into this category. Sorting can significantly reduce the complexity of a problem, and is often used for database algorithms and searches.
