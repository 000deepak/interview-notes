# Sorting

Sorting is an algorithm that arranges the elements of a list in a certain order [either ascending or descending]. The output is a permutation or reordering of the input.

Sorting is one of the important categories of algorithms in computer science and a lot of research has gone into this category. Sorting can significantly reduce the complexity of a problem, and is often used for database algorithms and searches.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm. It works by iterating the input array from the first element to the last, comparing each pair of elements and swapping them if needed. Bubble sort continues its iterations until no more swaps are needed.

The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements “`bubble`” to the top of the list. Generally, insertion sort has better performance than bubble sort.

The only significant advantage that bubble sort has over other implementations is that it can detect whether the input list is already sorted or not.

### Implementation

### Performance


| Type                                    | Complexity     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Worst case complexity                   | O(n2)          |
| Best case complexity (Improved version) | O(n)           |
| Average case complexity (Basic version) | O(n2)          |
| Worst case space complexity             | O(1) auxiliary |

## Selection Sort

Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. Selection sort works well for small files. It is used for sorting the files with very large values and small keys. This is because selection is made based on keys and swaps are made only when required.
