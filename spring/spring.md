Spring Boot Security using OAuth2 with JWT
-----------------------

OAuth2 is an authorization framework superseding it first version OAuth, created back in 2006. It defines the authorization flows between clients and one or more HTTP services in order to gain access to protected resources.

The main goal of the OAuth2 framework is to provide a simple flow of authorization that can be implemented on the web application, mobile phones, desktop application, and even on the devices used in our living rooms.

OAuth2 defines the following server-side roles:

- **Resource Owner**: The service responsible for controlling resourcesâ€™ access
- **Resource Server**: The service who actually supplies the resources
- **Authorization Server**: The service handling authorization process acting as a middleman between client and resource owner
- **JSON Web Token, or JWT**, is a specification for the representation of claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims are encoded as a JSON object used as the payload of an encrypted structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or encrypted.

OAuth2 Terminology
------------------
- **Resource Owner** The user who authorizes an application to access his account. The access is limited to the `scope`.
- **Resource Server:** A server that handles authenticated requests after the `client` has obtained an `access token`.
- **Client** An application that access protected resources on behalf of the resource owner.
- **Authorization Server** A server which issues access tokens after successfully authenticating a `client` and `resource owner`, and authorizing the request.
- **Access Token** A unique token used to access protected resources
- **Scope** A Permission
- **JWT** JSON Web Token is a method for representing claims securely between two parties.
- **Grant type** A `grant` is a method of acquiring an access token. 

Json Web Token(JWT)
------------------

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.a stateless authentication mechanism as the user state is never saved in server memory.A JWT token consists of 3 parts seperated with a dot(.) i.e. Header.payload.signature

Header has 2 parts type of token and hashing algorithm used.The JSON structure comprising these two keys are Base64Encoded.

```json
{
"alg": "HS256",
"typ": "JWT"
}
```
Payload contains the claims.Primarily, there are three types of claims: reserved, public, and private claims. Reserved claims are predefined claims such as iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience).In private claims, we can create some custom claims such as subject, role, and others.

```json
{
"sub": "Alex123",
"scopes": [
{
"authority": "ROLE_ADMIN"
}
],
"iss": "http://devglan.com",
"iat": 1508607322,
"exp": 1508625322
}
```
Signature ensures that the token is not changed on the way.For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:

```log
HMACSHA256(
base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
base64UrlEncode(payload),
secret)
```

```

_Spring Boot Rest Authentication with JWT Token Flow_
------------------
- Customers sign in by submitting their credentials to the provider.
- Upon successful authentication, it generates JWT containing user details and privileges for accessing the services and sets the JWT expiry date in payload.
- The server signs and encrypts the JWT if necessary and sends it to the client as a response with credentials to the initial request.
- Based on the expiration set by the server, the customer/client stores the JWT for a restricted or infinite amount of time.
- The client sends this JWT token in the header for all subsequent requests.
- The client authenticates the user with this token. So we don't need the client to send the user name and password to the server during each authentication process, but only once the server sends the client a JWT.
