Spring Boot
==========




Spring Boot Actuator
--------------------

- Actuator brings production-ready features to our application.
- Monitoring our app, gathering metrics, understanding traffic, or the state of our database become trivial with this dependency.
- The main benefit of this library is that we can get production-grade tools without having to actually implement these features ourselves.
- Actuator is mainly used to expose operational information about the running application â€” health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.
- Once this dependency is on the classpath, several endpoints are available for us out of the box. As with most Spring modules, we can easily configure or extend it in many ways.


spring-boot-actuator maven dependency
--------------------

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Predefined Endpoints
--------------------

- `/auditevents` lists security audit-related events such as user login/logout. Also, we can filter by principal or type among other fields.
- `/beans` returns all available beans in our BeanFactory. Unlike /auditevents, it doesn't support filtering.
- `/conditions`, formerly known as /autoconfig, builds a report of conditions around autoconfiguration.
- `/configprops` allows us to fetch all @ConfigurationProperties beans.
- `/env` returns the current environment properties. Additionally, we can retrieve single properties.
- `/flyway` provides details about our Flyway database migrations.
- `/health` summarizes the health status of our application.
- `/heapdump` builds and returns a heap dump from the JVM used by our application.
- `/info` returns general information. It might be custom data, build information or details about the latest commit.
- `/liquibase` behaves like /flyway but for Liquibase.
- `/logfile` returns ordinary application logs.
- `/loggers` enables us to query and modify the logging level of our application.
- `/metrics` details metrics of our application. This might include generic metrics as well as custom ones.
- `/prometheus` returns metrics like the previous one, but formatted to work with a Prometheus server.
- `/scheduledtasks` provides details about every scheduled task within our application.
- `/sessions` lists HTTP sessions given we are using Spring Session.
- `/shutdown` performs a graceful shutdown of the application.
- `/threaddump` dumps the thread information of the underlying JVM.


/info Endpoint
--------------------
We can also customize the data shown by the /info endpoint:
```properties
info.app.name=Spring Sample Application
info.app.description=This is my first spring boot application
info.app.version=1.0.0
```

And the sample output:

```json
{
    "app" : {
        "version" : "1.0.0",
        "description" : "This is my first spring boot application",
        "name" : "Spring Sample Application"
    }
}
```

/metrics Endpoint
--------------------
The metrics endpoint publishes information about OS and JVM as well as application-level metrics. Once enabled, we get information such as memory, heap, processors, threads, classes loaded, classes unloaded, and thread pools along with some HTTP metrics as well.

Here's what the output of this endpoint looks like out of the box:
```json
{
    "mem" : 193024,
    "mem.free" : 87693,
    "processors" : 4,
    "instance.uptime" : 305027,
    "uptime" : 307077,
    "systemload.average" : 0.11,
    "heap.committed" : 193024,
    "heap.init" : 124928,
    "heap.used" : 105330,
    "heap" : 1764352,
    "threads.peak" : 22,
    "threads.daemon" : 19,
    "threads" : 22,
    "classes" : 5819,
    "classes.loaded" : 5819,
    "classes.unloaded" : 0,
    "gc.ps_scavenge.count" : 7,
    "gc.ps_scavenge.time" : 54,
    "gc.ps_marksweep.count" : 1,
    "gc.ps_marksweep.time" : 44,
    "httpsessions.max" : -1,
    "httpsessions.active" : 0,
    "counter.status.200.root" : 1,
    "gauge.response.root" : 37.0
}
```

Custom Endpoint
--------------------
First, we need to have the new endpoint implement the Endpoint<T> interface:


```java
@Component
public class CustomEndpoint implements Endpoint<List<String>> {
    
    @Override
    public String getId() {
        return "customEndpoint";
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isEnabled() {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSensitive() {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public List<String> invoke() {
        // Custom logic to build the output
        List<String> messages = new ArrayList<String>();
        messages.add("This is message 1");
        messages.add("This is message 2");
        return messages;
    }
}
```
In order to access this new endpoint, its id is used to map it. In other words we could exercise it hitting /customEndpoint.

Output:
```log
[ "This is message 1", "This is message 2" ]
```
